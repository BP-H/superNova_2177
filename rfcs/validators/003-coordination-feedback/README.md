# Coordination Feedback Validator

<!-- Example path: rfcs/validators/003-coordination-feedback/README.md -->

## Summary
This RFC proposes a validator that feeds network coordination outcomes back into the reputation scoring system. By analyzing how participants align on shared tasks, the validator rewards collaborative success and flags disruptive behavior.

## Motivation
Network reputation currently focuses on individual actions. Integrating coordination results highlights teamwork and encourages constructive group dynamics.

## Specification
- Monitor metrics such as task completion rates, conflict resolution times, and consensus-building events.
- Compare expected versus actual coordination outcomes for groups of participants.
- Increase reputation for members who measurably improve coordination efficiency.
- Apply small penalties when behavior repeatedly disrupts group alignment.
- Store coordination feedback in a ledger tied to each participant.

## Rationale
Collaboration is essential to the project. Without feedback from coordination results, reputation may overvalue solo contributions and undervalue cooperation.

## Drawbacks
- Requires accurate tracking of coordination events and participant involvement.
- Adds complexity to the reputation calculation.

## Adoption Strategy
Begin with low weighting for coordination metrics while validating data collection. Gradually increase influence as the model proves reliable.

## Unresolved Questions
- Which coordination metrics should carry the most weight?
- How do we prevent unfair penalties for healthy disagreement?
