# Request for Comments

This folder houses design proposals for the project. Each RFC lives in a
subdirectory named with a four digit number followed by a short hyphenated
name, e.g. `0001-example-proposal`. Numbers should be zero padded so
that directories sort lexicographically.

When authoring a new RFC, copy [`template.md`](template.md) into your
new directory's `README.md` and fill out each section.
