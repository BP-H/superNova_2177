**A scientifically grounded social metaverse engine for collaborative creativity**

This repository hosts `superNova_2177.py` — an experimental protocol merging computational sociology, quantum-aware simulation logic, and creative systems engineering. It models symbolic influence, interaction entropy, and network resonance across users and content, with classical compatibility and quantum-readiness.

⚠️ This is *not* a financial product, cryptocurrency, or tradable asset. All metrics (e.g., Harmony Score, Resonance, Entropy) are symbolic — for modeling, visualization, and creative gameplay only. See legal/disclaimer sections in `superNova_2177.py`, lines 60–88.

# superNova_2177 🧠

**AI-Powered Scientific Validation with Built-In Integrity Scoring**

A modular intelligence pipeline that evaluates hypotheses through evidence-based validation, peer review scoring, and manipulation resistance.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Try demo mode
python validate_hypothesis.py --demo

# Run your own validation set
python validate_hypothesis.py --validations sample_validations.json
````
## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This project is tested with **SQLAlchemy 2.x**, so ensure you have
`sqlalchemy>=2.0` installed.
The code also requires `python-dateutil` for timestamp parsing.

## 🏁 Getting Started

Set up a Python environment and install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the full test suite to verify your setup:

```bash
pytest
```

## 🔧 Configuration

`SECRET_KEY` **must** be supplied via environment variables for JWT signing.  A
strong random value is recommended:

```bash
export SECRET_KEY="your-random-secret"
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set values for `SECRET_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`,
and `BACKEND_URL` before running the app.

## 🧪 Running Tests

After installing the dependencies, run:

```bash
pytest
```

Some tests rely on optional packages such as `networkx`. Install them
with `pip install networkx` to run the full test suite.
Certain modules and tests also require `numpy`. Install it with
`pip install numpy` if it isn't already available.

## ✨ Features

* **🧠 Smart Scoring** — Combines confidence, signal strength, and NLP sentiment
* **🛡️ Manipulation Detection** — Flags collusion, bias, and temporal anomalies
* **📊 Multi-Factor Analysis** — Diversity, reputation, coordination, timing
* **📋 Actionable Reports** — Output includes flags, scores, certification level
* **🧵 Fully Modular** — Each analysis step is plug-and-play

## 📈 Example Output

```
🔬 VALIDATION REPORT — superNova_2177
=============================================

✅ CERTIFICATION: PROVISIONAL
📊 Consensus Score: 0.782
👥 Validators: 5

🛡️ INTEGRITY
Risk Level: MEDIUM
Integrity Score: 0.683
Flags: ['limited_consensus', 'low_diversity']

💡 Recommendation:
- Add more validators from diverse affiliations
- Check timestamp clustering for coordination risks
```

## 🏗️ Architecture (v4.6)

* `validation_integrity_pipeline.py` — Orchestrator for full validation logic
* `reputation_influence_tracker.py` — Tracks and scores validators over time
* `diversity_analyzer.py` — Detects echo chambers and affiliation bias
* `temporal_consistency_checker.py` — Tracks time-based volatility
* `network_coordination_detector.py` — Spots suspicious group behavior

## 🧪 Status

**v4.6 — Stable & Ready**

* Robust CLI
* Structured error handling
* Transparent results
* Designed for peer-reviewable output

---

*Built for scientific integrity in a world of noise.*
