**A scientifically grounded social metaverse engine for collaborative creativity**

This repository hosts `superNova_2177.py` — an experimental protocol merging computational sociology, quantum-aware simulation logic, and creative systems engineering. It models symbolic influence, interaction entropy, and network resonance across users and content, with classical compatibility and quantum-readiness.

⚠️ This is *not* a financial product, cryptocurrency, or tradable asset. All metrics (e.g., Harmony Score, Resonance, Entropy) are symbolic — for modeling, visualization, and creative gameplay only. See legal/disclaimer sections in `superNova_2177.py`, lines 60–88.
Symbolic tokens and listings introduced in the gameplay modules have **no real-world monetary value**. They exist purely as resonance artifacts used for cooperative storytelling.

## 📦 Installation

### Step-by-Step

1. **Install Python 3.11 or newer** from [python.org](https://www.python.org/)
   if it isn't already on your machine. This project requires Python 3.11+.
   You can check by running `python --version` in your terminal.
2. **Run the setup script** to create the virtual environment and install all
   dependencies locally. Install any missing system libraries first (see
   [System Packages](#system-packages)). You can also pass `--locked` to install packages from
   `requirements.lock` for deterministic builds. Additional flags `--run-app`
   and `--build-ui` can automatically start the API or compile the frontend:
   ```bash
   python setup_env.py
   # python setup_env.py --run-app    # launch API after install
   # python setup_env.py --locked     # install from requirements.lock
   # python setup_env.py --build-ui   # build NiceGUI frontend assets
   ```
  You can also let `install.py` choose the appropriate installer for your
  platform:
  ```bash
  python install.py
  ```
 This project depends on libraries such as `fastapi`, `pydantic-settings`, `structlog`, `prometheus-client`, and core packages like `numpy`, `python-dateutil`, `sqlalchemy>=2.0`, and `email-validator`. The full list lives in `requirements.txt`. A pared-down `requirements-minimal.txt` installs only what is necessary to run the unit tests.
  If you prefer to manage the environment manually, install the required
  packages yourself using `requirements.txt`:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt  # installs numpy, python-dateutil, email-validator, etc.
  ```
   A PyPI wheel is currently unavailable. Run `python setup_env.py` or use the online installer scripts:
   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS
   ./online_install.sh
   # Windows
  ./online_install.ps1
  ```
3. **Activate the environment**:
   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS
   source venv/bin/activate
   # Windows
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. You're ready to run the demo commands shown in [Quick Start](#-quick-start).

### System Packages

Install these system dependencies if they're missing on your platform:

**Ubuntu**

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential libsnappy-dev libsdl2-dev …
```

**macOS**

```bash
brew install snappy sdl2 …
```

### Makefile Quick Commands

For convenience, the repository includes a `Makefile` with common tasks:

```bash
make install  # set up the environment
make test     # run tests
make lint     # run mypy type checks
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Set up pre-commit to automatically format and lint the code:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pre-commit install
```

You can run all checks manually with:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Platform Quick Commands

**Windows PowerShell**

```powershell
./online_install.ps1
```

**macOS (bash)**

```bash
./online_install.sh
```

**Linux (bash)**

```bash
./online_install.sh
```

**Docker**

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

**Offline Installer**

```bash
python one_click_install.py
```

This script automatically installs the `tqdm` package if it isn't available so
that progress bars work out of the box.

This project relies on features introduced in **SQLAlchemy 2.x** such as
`DeclarativeBase`. Ensure you have `sqlalchemy>=2.0` installed. The code also
requires `python-dateutil` for timestamp parsing.

## 🏁 Getting Started

Set up a Python environment and install the package and its dependencies:

```bash
pip install .
# install optional libraries used by the tests
pip install -r requirements.txt
# To install the exact versions used during development,
# use the generated `requirements.lock` file instead:
# pip install -r requirements.lock
```

Run the full test suite to verify your setup:

```bash
pytest
```

## 🔧 Configuration

`SECRET_KEY` can be supplied via environment variables for JWT signing. If it is
not set, a secure random value will be generated automatically:

```bash
# optional
export SECRET_KEY="your-random-secret"
```

`METRICS_PORT` configures the Prometheus metrics server port. Override it if the
default `8001` is unavailable:

```bash
export METRICS_PORT=9000
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set values for `SECRET_KEY` and
`BACKEND_URL`. Provide your own connection string for `DATABASE_URL` via
environment variables rather than hard-coding it. Set `DB_MODE=central` if you
want to use a shared PostgreSQL instance instead of the default local SQLite
file.

## 🐳 Docker

You can build a standalone Docker image or run the API with Postgres and Redis
via `docker-compose`.

Build the image:
```bash
docker build -t supernova-2177 .
```

Or bring up the full stack:
```bash
cp .env.example .env  # set your own secrets
docker-compose up
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## 🎛️ Local Streamlit UI

To experiment with the validation analyzer locally, launch the Streamlit frontend:

```bash
streamlit run ui.py
```
Or run `make ui` from the repository root to start the demo.
`ui.py` replaces the previous `app.py` script and is now the canonical entry
point for the Streamlit interface.
Run these commands from the repository root. **Do not** execute `python ui.py`
directly as that bypasses Streamlit's runtime.

Open [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) in your browser to interact with the demo.

`ui.py` reads configuration from `st.secrets` when running under Streamlit. If
the secrets dictionary is unavailable (such as during local development), the
module falls back to a development setup equivalent to:

```python
{"SECRET_KEY": "dev", "DATABASE_URL": "sqlite:///:memory:"}
```

## 📊 Dashboard

The dashboard provides real-time integrity metrics and network graphs built with `streamlit`, `networkx`, and `matplotlib`. Upload your validations JSON or enable demo mode to populate the table. You can edit rows inline before re-running the analysis to see how scores change.

```bash
streamlit run ui.py
```

Use the sidebar file uploader to select or update your dataset, then click **Run Analysis** to refresh the report.
Missing packages such as `tqdm` are installed automatically when you run `one_click_install.py` so progress bars work without extra setup.

## 🌩️ Streamlit Cloud

Deploy the demo UI online with Streamlit Cloud:

1. Fork this repository on GitHub.
2. Sign in to [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) and select **New app**.
3. Choose the repo and set `ui.py` as the entry point.
4. Add your `SECRET_KEY` and set a `DATABASE_URL` secret with your connection string under **Secrets** in the app settings.
5. Streamlit will install dependencies from `requirements.txt` and launch the app.

After the build completes, you'll get a shareable URL to interact with the validation demo in your browser.

## 🧪 Running Tests

Install the testing requirements first using `requirements-dev.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest
```

This file includes `pytest` and all libraries required for development.
For a lightweight setup you can instead install the reduced set from
`requirements-minimal.txt` or use `requirements.txt`/`requirements.lock`
for the full environment.

Before running the tests, install the packages from `requirements.txt` (or the expanded minimal file) if you want the real dependencies. Otherwise, the built-in stubs will activate automatically. Use the setup script with locked versions or `pip` directly:

```bash
python setup_env.py --locked  # install from requirements.lock
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Test Requirements

Before running `pre-commit` or `pytest`, install the minimal set of packages required for the tests:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-minimal.txt
```

`requirements-minimal.txt` installs `fastapi`, `pydantic`,
`pydantic-settings`, `python-multipart`, `structlog`,
`prometheus-client` and the core scientific packages (`numpy`,
`python-dateutil`, `sqlalchemy`, `networkx`, `pytest-asyncio`, `httpx`,
`email-validator`). With these installed, running `pytest` should
succeed (`99 passed`).

> **Important**
> CI and local testing rely on these packages. Always run
> `pip install -r requirements-minimal.txt` **before** invoking
> `pre-commit` or `pytest`. Skipping this step triggers the simplified
> stubs in `stubs/` and can cause numerous test failures.

If the packages are missing, stub implementations in `stubs/`
activate automatically. This allows `pytest` to succeed but may not
exercise the full functionality of optional modules.

### Real Module Dependencies

The test suite falls back to lightweight stubs when optional packages
are missing. To exercise the real authentication module, install the
actual libraries:

```bash
pip install redis passlib[bcrypt] python-jose[cryptography]
```

Installing both requirement files ensures all dependencies used in CI
are available:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-minimal.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Run `pytest` after installing the packages to validate your setup.

### Makefile Commands

For a quicker workflow you can use the provided `Makefile`:

```bash
# install project dependencies
make install

# run the full test suite
make test

# run static type checks
make lint
```

## 📦 Building an Executable

You can package the command line interface into a standalone binary using
PyInstaller. Run the helper script:

```bash
scripts/build_executable.sh
```

On Windows, use the PowerShell version:

```powershell
scripts/build_executable.ps1
```

To build installers for all supported platforms in one step, execute:

```bash
scripts/build_all_installers.sh
```

This wrapper calls `build_executable.sh`, `build_executable.ps1`,
`build_appimage.sh`, and `supernova_installer.nsi` in sequence to create the
`.msi`, `.dmg`, and `.AppImage` files inside `dist/`.

The generated executable will be placed under `dist/` as `supernova-cli` on
Unix systems or `supernova-cli.exe` on Windows.

### Running the Installer

If you're on Windows, download `supernova-cli.exe` from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/BP-H/superNova_2177/releases/latest)
or build it yourself with the script above. Before launching, set the required
environment variables so the application can connect to its services. `SECRET_KEY`
is optional because a secure one will be generated if omitted:

```bash
# optional
export SECRET_KEY="your-secret"
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql+asyncpg://<username>:<password>@<hostname>/<database>"
export BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:8000"
```

To connect to a central database instead of the local file, pass
`--db-mode central` when launching the application or set `DB_MODE=central`.

After setting the variables, execute the binary directly:

```bash
./supernova-cli --demo   # on Windows use supernova-cli.exe
```

### One-Click Installers

Prebuilt installers for each platform are published under the [Releases page](https://github.com/BP-H/superNova_2177/releases).
Each installer bundles Python 3.11 and all dependencies so it works offline:

* **Windows** – download [`SuperNova_2177.msi`](dist/SuperNova_2177.msi) and run
  it to install the CLI.
* **macOS** – open [`supernova-cli.dmg`](dist/supernova-cli.dmg) and drag the app
  to `Applications`.
* **Linux** – download [`supernova-cli.AppImage`](dist/supernova-cli.AppImage),
  make it executable with `chmod +x` and run it directly.

```powershell
# Windows
./SuperNova_2177.msi
```

```bash
# macOS
open supernova-cli.dmg
```

```bash
# Linux
chmod +x supernova-cli.AppImage
./supernova-cli.AppImage
```

If you prefer to build everything locally, run:

```bash
python one_click_install.py
```

The script detects your OS, downloads Python 3.11 if necessary, bundles the
dependencies into `offline_deps/`, creates a virtual environment, and installs
the package.

```
🔬 VALIDATION REPORT — superNova_2177
=============================================

✅ CERTIFICATION: PROVISIONAL
📊 Consensus Score: 0.782
👥 Validators: 5

🛡️ INTEGRITY
Risk Level: MEDIUM
Integrity Score: 0.683
Flags: ['limited_consensus', 'low_diversity']

💡 Recommendation:

- Check timestamp clustering for coordination risks
```

## 🔮 Fork Metrics

`supernova-federate create` computes an *entropy divergence* value for each new fork.
This is the mean absolute deviation between your provided configuration and the
default `Config` parameters. After harmonizers vote with `supernova-federate vote`,
the CLI recalculates a consensus score using `quantum_consensus`. When the
optional `qutip` dependency is installed, this applies a Pauli-Z expectation over
all votes; otherwise it falls back to a simple majority fraction.

Both divergence and consensus are **symbolic gameplay indicators** only — they
carry no real financial or governance weight.

## 📓 Jupyter Examples

Two notebooks in `docs/` showcase how to run the validation pipeline and plot
coordination graphs using the sample data in `sample_validations.json`.

Launch them from the repository root:

```bash
jupyter notebook docs/Validation_Pipeline.ipynb
jupyter notebook docs/Network_Graph_Visualization.ipynb
```

## 🏗️ Architecture (v4.6)

* `validation_integrity_pipeline.py` — Orchestrator for full validation logic
* `reputation_influence_tracker.py` — Tracks and scores validators over time
* `diversity_analyzer.py` — Detects echo chambers and affiliation bias
* `temporal_consistency_checker.py` — Tracks time-based volatility
* `network_coordination_detector.py` — Spots suspicious group behavior using
  sentence‑embedding similarity

## 🧪 Status

**v4.6 — Stable & Ready**

* Robust CLI
* Structured error handling
* Transparent results
* Designed for peer-reviewable output
